Creating a simple example of implementing CRUD functions 
________________________________________________________

Each child component has a direct relationship to it's parent component. 

App component will hold and render all other components within the app

Form component will add items to the list 

List component will map through all the items from the Form component  and render them in DOM 

Items will hold functionality for each Form input that was made such as EDIT and DELETE the item from the List
